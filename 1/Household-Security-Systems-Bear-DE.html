<p>Thanks to recent advancements in technology, wireless security systems are now as effective as wired systems If you've made the decision to install a burglar alarm, you should think about the following advantages of wireless innovation. The $260 Essentials package includes the base station, a keypad, four entry sensing units, one motion sensor, a lawn indication, and 2 window decals. For $15 per month, you can add around-the-clock professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline.
