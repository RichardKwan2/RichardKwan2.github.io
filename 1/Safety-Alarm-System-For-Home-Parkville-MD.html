Not only is the Arlo fast to pick out moving products, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple decades ago, the home security industry was controlled by a few big names using expensive, rigid strategies with little versatility and hostile, long-term agreements.
