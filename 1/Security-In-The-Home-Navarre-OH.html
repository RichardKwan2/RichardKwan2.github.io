Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days.

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody entering the shop.
