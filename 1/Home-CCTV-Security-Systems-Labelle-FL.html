Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
