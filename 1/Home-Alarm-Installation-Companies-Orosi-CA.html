<p>The 2nd main distinction is the pricing. Wired systems can be notoriously costly. Every element of the system will cost you money. So, at the end, who's robbing who? With prices so high, it often isn't worth it for house owners to have a wired security system unless their budget is broad enough to fit the system comfortably.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
