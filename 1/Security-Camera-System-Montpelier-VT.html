<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search technology that is quickly changing the security industry, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Learning and why is it so essential?  For starters, Deep Knowing allows someone to discover what they are trying to find without needing to search through hours of ineffective video footage.  Envision a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the aspects you are trying to find in the tape-recorded video footage.
