The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
