Obviously, the apparent downside to a wired security system is that the preliminary install can be costly. If the system was not set up during the homebuilding procedure, setting one up might need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and gaining access to challenging spots that are sealed in attics or basements. Wired security systems are also susceptible to power blackouts.

DVRs transform the analog video to digital, which assists to extend storage capacity, makes it a lot easier to browse archived video footage, and also permits users to stream video over a network for remote watching from several locations.
