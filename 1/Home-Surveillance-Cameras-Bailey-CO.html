<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
