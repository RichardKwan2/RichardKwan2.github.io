<h3>Recommended Home Security Systems in Ohio</h3>
<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, informs, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Ring's professional monitoring plan is likewise one of the best offers out there. For a $10 minimum (or $100 for the entire year), you can receive customized motion informs, live views from your Ring camera, video recording for approximately 60 days, and professional monitoring. Priority action and cutting edge verification services and Improved Call Verification (ECV) -- Incorrect alarms are a substantial issue for local police and emergency personnel and might postpone a reaction.

Do not DIY your wise home security system - the pros at Vivint are completely worth the cost.</p>
