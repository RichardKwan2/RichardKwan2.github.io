The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
