Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you walk by.
