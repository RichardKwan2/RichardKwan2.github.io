<p>Motion sensors provide backup protection in case a burglar handles to get into your home. However they only operate when you're out of the house. Don't believe they'll protect you if someone enters when you're sleeping! Quite the opposite, your alarm system really ignores motion sensor signals if you arm the system but stay at home.

<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much suffices. In this article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image.

Surveillance cameras are also made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
