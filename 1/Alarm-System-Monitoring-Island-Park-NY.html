<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can record approximately 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline.
