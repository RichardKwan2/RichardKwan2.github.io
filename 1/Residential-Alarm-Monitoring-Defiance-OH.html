In addition to operating as a deterrent, cameras can notify cops of criminal offenses as they happen, which can allow officers to react quickly and efficiently (La Vigne et al. 2011). On a bigger scale, the use of CCTV also presents the possibility of aiding in the criminal justice system, as video footage of a criminal activity might help in investigations and prosecutions (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>

Techniques included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV evaluation study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV assessments, and contacting leading researchers to inquire about forthcoming examinations.

<h3>Wireless Home Security Alarm in Ohio</h3>
<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive enemy, since the interruption of the network avoids the flow of data and actually indirectly safeguards information by preventing it from being sent. The usual factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the destructive aggressor to record these codes and use various breaking tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security key captured during the network recovery.</p>
