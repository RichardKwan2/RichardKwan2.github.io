<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later developed to resolve the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those file encryption plans, any customer in the network that understands the secrets can read all the traffic.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
