The alarm is simply one of 2 we evaluated that consists of an external siren, and we're satisfied that it likewise includes a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further dissuading anyone from attempting to break in to your residential or commercial property. We checked Somfy's more pricey system, which featured a wifi security camera, but more budget-friendly packages are likewise offered.

When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
