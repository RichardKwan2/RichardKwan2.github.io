In lower Manhattan, for instance, the police are planning to set up a central surveillance center where officers can see countless camera around the downtown - and police-operated cameras have proliferated in numerous other cities throughout America in just the previous a number of years.</p>
<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective offenders are less likely to commit criminal offense if they believe they are being seen or have a higher risk of being captured.

Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
