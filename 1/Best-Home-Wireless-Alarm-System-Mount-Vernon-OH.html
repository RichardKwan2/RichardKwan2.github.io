<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the precise same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
