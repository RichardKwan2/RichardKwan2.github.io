<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the obligation of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to save and how long you prepare to keep recorded video. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space rapidly.
