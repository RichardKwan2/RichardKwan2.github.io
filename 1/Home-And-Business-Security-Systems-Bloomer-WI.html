If you wish to view a large area, you should think about a camera with a very wide field of view. The capability to mechanically pan and tilt the camera is a great possession as well.</p>
<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
