<p>In the modern day, with our rampant internet usage, we've become surprisingly indifferent in our approach to home security. Just think how much information you distribute when you do a basic online grocery order: your name, your address, the example you buy, what times you'll be around (and, by extension, what times you'll be out). You might even offer directions on how to enter into your building. As recently as 10 years ago, customers did not have access to technology that let them handle their own home security systems. Smart alarm systems changed that. Originally, traditional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a main station, typically a home alarm company. The customer paid month-to-month costs.</p>
<p>The second main difference is the prices. Wired systems can be infamously costly. Every element of the system will cost you cash. So, at the end, who's robbing who?

Their low cost is one of the reasons why they have actually ended up being so popular over the past a number of years.</p>
