<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
