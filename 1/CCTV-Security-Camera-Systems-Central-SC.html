<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to strive to make a camera with the most difficult setup known to male. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You need to play this at complete volume or it will not work).
