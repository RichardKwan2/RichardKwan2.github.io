<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
