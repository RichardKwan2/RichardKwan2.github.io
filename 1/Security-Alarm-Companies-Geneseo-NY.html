<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems meant to summon police department workers, requires registration, evaluation of fees for extreme false alarm system, offers treatments for repeat offenders, and provides a reliable date. While some vestiges of the old industry remain, today's property owners are presented with a lot more alternatives.

We dug into what each provider needs to provide, and put those services in the context of Seattle crime and home security patterns.
