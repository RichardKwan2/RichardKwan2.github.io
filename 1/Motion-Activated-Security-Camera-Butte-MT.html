Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
