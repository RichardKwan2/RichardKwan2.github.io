Here's a look at the basic elements of a typical CCTV system. We have a CCTV Security Pros IP Camera & NVR system at our church. We began with 16 cameras & have actually grown to 25 cameras. When we needed to add new cameras or fix problems, Tim in Tech Assistance has actually been extremely useful. He is really patient with those of us that don't have expertise in the IP world. Tim understands what great customer support is everything about. This company stands behind their items.</p>

Wide-angle lenses reduce the number of cameras needed to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that might reveal a 360-degree view, however the best security cameras have a view of at least 100 degrees or better.

You can get a photovoltaic panel accessory so you do not need to eliminate the battery as typically, but it'll cost you extra.
