The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
