<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the deck by a certified electrician (who occurs to be my husband).
