<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Suggestion: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We should again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of removing expensive incorrect alarms.

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.

It can compare basic motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually identified (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.

<p>We needed guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to safeguard the line camping tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heating unit at 5am.
