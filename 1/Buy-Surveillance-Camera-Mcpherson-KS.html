PTZ cameras are remotely controlled, and allow the operator to pan (move left or best), tilt up and or down, or zoom more detailed or farther away in order to follow individuals as they move. This lets operators zoom in on particular locations or track particular motions. The cameras can also turn or run patterns to a predetermined position.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

However, those features come at a comparatively high price: $5 each month ($50 per year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 each year) for 1 month of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the preliminary cost. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 per month for person detection with 1 month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those features and bumps storage up to 31 days.</p>
<p>This cost is various from company to company. If you acquire a security system on Amazon and can not install it yourself, then you will have to employ an alarm company to install it for you.
