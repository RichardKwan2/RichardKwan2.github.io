<h3>Home Window Security in Ozone Park NY</h3>
<p>What's not to like about the Arlo Ultra? This camera takes cutting edge to new heights and features a lots of essential features we have not seen in a single camera (or at all) in the past. SimpliSafe develops and sells its own devices.

<p>The Hive View delivers excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
