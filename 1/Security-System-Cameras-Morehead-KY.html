If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA essentially uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
