The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive price and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
