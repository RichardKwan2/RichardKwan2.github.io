<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera also functions as a motion detector. It is geared up with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor, so whenever there's some motion identified, it can send you a push notice in your phone so you can react to it right away. Additionally, the motion sensor here is much more innovative than the ones provided by adobe Starter Kit. Given that it is a PIR motion sensing unit, it just gets activated when it captures motion from something releasing infrared energy, i.e., animals and people. Additionally, it doesn't get set off by small items. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has among the most sophisticated motion sensing units that get rid of all incorrect alarms and only gets activated when individuals approach it.</p>
