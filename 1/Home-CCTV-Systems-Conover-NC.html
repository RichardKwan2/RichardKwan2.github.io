<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face acknowledgment software application. The latter allows you to see exactly when a specific person gets to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has actually broadened its security range with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors known as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to release a smart smoke detector and siren later on this year, which makes this an even much better proposal.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
