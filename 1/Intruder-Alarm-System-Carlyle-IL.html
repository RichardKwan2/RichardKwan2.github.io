<p>Security: There have actually been lots of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, child displays, and other Wi-Fi devices to spy on people, so make sure to inspect what steps has each manufacturer taken to remove this issue.

If your motion sensing unit is triggered, you get a notice in your mobile phone app. There's no latency so you get alerted instantly so you can take instant actions such as activating a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or utilizing the camera's two-way audio system to speak with the prospective burglars.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
