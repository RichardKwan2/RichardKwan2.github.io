<p>The real factor cameras are typically deployed is to minimize much pettier criminal offenses. However it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been extensively deployed in public places, sociologists studying the problem have actually found that they have actually not lowered crime. "When the criminal offense and offence figures were gotten used to take account of the general down trend in offenses and crimes," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were noted in specific classifications but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had lowered criminal activity overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 study, also for the British federal government).</p>
