<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
