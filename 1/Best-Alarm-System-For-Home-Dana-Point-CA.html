Depending on the lens' field of view, it can see in between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a huge range in regards to the camera's vision cone. You should consider a camera with a really large field of view if you desire to see a large location. The ability to mechanically pan and tilt the camera is an excellent property as well.</p>

<h3>Best Home Security System in California</h3>
<p>We don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, signals, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Brinks uses basic home security choices and straightforward prices.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
