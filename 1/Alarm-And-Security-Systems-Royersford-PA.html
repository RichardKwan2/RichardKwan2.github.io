We've discovered lots here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, however you'll discover more than 30 brand names available. In some cases you do not have an option. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT offer only professional installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a DIY alternative. ADT does not have the strongest client service reputation among the companies we thought about, racking up more than 3,000 complaints on its Bbb page While we chalked the majority of this up to the truth that ADT has a number of million more consumers than its rivals, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
