Convenience is the significant reason individuals change to wireless," says Du, and it's tough to argue against a 10-minute setup when the wired option requires professional installation of wires below your house. On the other hand, an alarm that is expertly monitored streamlines this process. Minutes after an alarm is activated, a monitoring specialist checks in with you. If there is a true emergency situation, the monitoring experts will dispatch authorities on your behalf.</p>
