<h3>CCTV Security System in Dixon IL</h3>

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you stroll by.
