<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a terrific alternative for long range scenarios where trees and poles are not present.</p>

SimpliSafe develops and sells its own gadgets. The quality of this equipment seems satisfactory to many users, though it can't be used with a different monitoring service like third-party equipment might. ADT is one of the more pricey home security companies, with pricey video monitoring and high early termination costs.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
