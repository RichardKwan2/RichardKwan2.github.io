Lots of insurance provider provide discount rates on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments use a number of "complimentary" false alarms before imposing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is substantial right from the start.
