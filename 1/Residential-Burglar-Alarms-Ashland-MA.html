<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
