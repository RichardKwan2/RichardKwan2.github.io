<h2>Which Camera Security System Is Right For Me Muldrow</h2>

Our systems are programmed so that we get your alarm signal instantly.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you've identified (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
