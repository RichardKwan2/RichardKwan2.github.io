<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were often missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With basic smart home devices like automatic door locks, you can stay in bed and inspect that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for potential package thieves or talk to visitors who visit.</p>

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.
