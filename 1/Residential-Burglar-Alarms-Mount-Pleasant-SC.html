<p>Home security systems and contemporary smart home capabilities and compatibilities permit you to take advantage of their sensors and cameras straight from your phone. Look for a design that uses a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety as much as 25 feet, and inexpensive cloud storage for tape-recorded video.
