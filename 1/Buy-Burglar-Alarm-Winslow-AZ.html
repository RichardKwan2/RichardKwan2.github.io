<p>Research studies reveal surveillance cameras decrease criminal offense. HD CCTV systems work with traditional analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cord behind the TV that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that indicates you have conventional analog CCTV security cameras. You can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax infrastructure if you buy HD-CCTV security system. That's just $0.63 a day (or about $19 a month) for the Residence Iota All-in-One security camera, an additional contact sensing unit, and a remote crucial fob.

<p>Though most of our attention nowadays is focused on the transition to IP video technology, it is essential to note that analog CCTV security cameras can still be extremely effective for lots of surveillance applications, especially those on a budget. With standard CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transmitted in analog format for local seeing from one central monitoring place. However that does not indicate you can't use analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Utilizing IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to leverage your existing analog cameras while moving into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
