<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
