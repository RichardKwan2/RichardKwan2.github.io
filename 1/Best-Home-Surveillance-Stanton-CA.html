<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see below) technically has all the very same smarts and more detailed 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , since its image quality is still exceptional, and it's somewhat much better worth - though its cost is still its achilles' heel. Still, what you get for the cash is all the usual Arlo traits in terms of the strong construct quality, excellent camera footage, lots of clever functions and a sleek app.</p>
<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the hub) is $399, and extra cameras are $299 each. The Arlo Ultra doesn't featured a complimentary tier of cloud storage, so you have to spend at least $3 each month if you wish to save any videos. And if you want to conserve 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera each month, on top of the regular monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the first year.

For even more basic smarts, it's terrific, though. If you don't currently have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to require to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can suggest there are range concerns.</p>
