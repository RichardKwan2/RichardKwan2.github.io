<p>TP-Link's Kasa Webcam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that could measure up to a few of our top picks. It also features two days of complimentary cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can pack in clips of as much as 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control board and keypads, various sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.
