This system might not be the best fit if you have a large yard or sheds to protect. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q doesn't require a base station-- it connects directly to any Wi-Fi network. However you can connect the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web internet browser.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
