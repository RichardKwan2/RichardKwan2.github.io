<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, should offer a minimum of a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly charge ).
