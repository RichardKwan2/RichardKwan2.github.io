<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger area and for that reason uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients recognize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
