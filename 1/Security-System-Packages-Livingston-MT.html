<p>Self-monitored systems, like many security systems, are offered online and are normally offered in packages.

<p>Hybrid systems utilize both wired and wireless sensing units to accomplish the advantages of both. Transmitters can also be connected through the premises' electrical circuits to transmit coded signals to the control system (line carrier). The control system normally has a different channel or zone for burglar and fire sensing units, and better systems have a different zone for every various sensor, along with internal trouble signs (mains power loss, low battery, damaged wire, etc.).</p>
