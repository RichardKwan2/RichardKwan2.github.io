Nest Aware subscriptions are priced per camera, and if you wish to opt out of spending for storage completely, Nest only gives you as much as three hours worth of recordings. Wired security systems are linked by hard-wired cables and require access to power outlets, making them more difficult to place and install. Wireless systems, on the other hand, use a WiFi connection, fast to establish, and can be placed anywhere inside (or outside) your home.</p>
