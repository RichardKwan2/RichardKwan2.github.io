<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras minimize criminal activity. HD CCTV systems are compatible with traditional analog CCTV cameras. If you bought cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable (look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that suggests you have conventional analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax infrastructure.

There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have essential fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
