<p>Most of the cameras we evaluated require an AC outlet, so positioning is certainly a factor. A few models use batteries, making positioning more flexible, but this requires other trade-offs, which we highlight in the Competitors section. Wi-Fi coverage also impacts where you place a camera: If you want to put a camera in an area that doesn't get a good Wi-Fi signal, think about updating your router or including an extender or repeater. (For a look at our networking choices, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for Most People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good rule of thumb that if your smart device or laptop computer gets decent Wi-Fi reception in the area you wish to install the camera, you likely will not have an issue.</p>
<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, due to the fact that it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
