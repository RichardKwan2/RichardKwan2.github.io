<p>If an employee (trusted entity) generates a wireless router and plugs it into an unsecured switchport, the whole network can be exposed to anyone within range of the signals. Similarly, if a staff member adds a wireless interface to a networked computer using an open USB port, they might create a breach in network security that would permit access to confidential products.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider area and for that reason provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the porch by a certified electrician (who takes place to be my other half).
