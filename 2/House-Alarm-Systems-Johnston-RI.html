<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
<p>There's a lot to like about the Maximus Camera Floodlight, beginning with its camera's crisp, clear 1080p video. Its dual articulating LED floodlights cover a very broad area, and you can dim them through its app if you want mood lighting on your deck or patio area for a party. Additionally they can not send fluid video, just still frame images or low resolution bits of video. Blink Security Cameras are a good example of a system we are constantly helping customers replace. As specialists in the market our recommendations is to stay away. If you do buy them, first examine the providers return policy and 2nd keep the receipt.</p>
