<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you require additional cable televisions. DVR systems are hard to scale up because as soon as every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to buy a completely new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the linked cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Analog hd cameras are an excellent alternative for companies to upgrade from analog CCTV that has currently been wired using coax cable television or CAT-5 cable.
