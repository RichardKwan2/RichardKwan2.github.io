<h3>Home Security System Service in Virginia</h3>
<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it needs to be. Recordings, informs, and integration all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
