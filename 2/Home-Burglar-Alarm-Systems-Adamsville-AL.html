<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and definitely enjoy it. Great clearness. I wished to set up seeing on my mobile phone however had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter alerts, for example. Nevertheless, those features come at a relatively steep cost: $5 each month ($50 each year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 annually) for thirty days of video history.
