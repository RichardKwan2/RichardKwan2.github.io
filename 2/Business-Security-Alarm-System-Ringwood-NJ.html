<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
