Create a database of family and friends and get alerts telling you "Molly" or "Andrew" is at the door.</p>
<p>There is an agreement involved, however that's par for the course when it comes to premium wireless systems like Alder We believe the functions and tech more than justify the agreement and costs.

<h3>Best Rated Home Security Systems in Oregon</h3>
<p>Commercial residential or commercial properties tend to have even higher false alarm rates than residential properties since more individuals tend to share responsibility for triggering and shutting down the alarm, and the systems tend to be more complicated.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
