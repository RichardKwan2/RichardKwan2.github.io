The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
