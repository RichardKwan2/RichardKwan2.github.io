<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
