<h3>Video Surveillance System Westville IN 46391</h3>
<p>Blink cameras are compact, include complimentary storage, and use 2 AA batteries that can last up to two years. However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not provide you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.

These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is really fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
