<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
