<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public areas.

As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You don't wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "individuals might find out to be careful about the regulars and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang druggies, hookers or members." Undoubtedly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that people considered to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings went through prolonged surveillance.</p>

Flood lights can deter vandals or frighten them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your peace of mind than for home protection.</p>
