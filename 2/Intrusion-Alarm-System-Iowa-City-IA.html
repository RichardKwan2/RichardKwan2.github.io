The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to properly identify motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That likewise conserves battery life, but it may leave you with taping gaps during important security occasions. If home security is your primary issue, we 'd advise one of our top picks, but the Arlo is terrific for signing in on household and family pets-- or stray cats slinking around your yard.</p>

If you go with a bundle that does not consist of live video surveillance, consider purchasing a standalone security camera.
