Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control board and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. They are the only company of the 4 discussed that utilizes a combination of wired and wireless technology so keep that in mind when making a decision.</p>
