<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
