Alarms activated by legal however unexpected entry to the property, i.e. kids returning home, guests, next-door neighbors looking after the home while you are on holiday and delivery men do not fulfill the requirement for waiver.</p>
<p>The main distinction is the way the signal is sent Analogue systems turn the signal into a format a Video recorder or television screen can receive.
