<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their expandability, mobility and impermanence. Tenants, unlike property owners, typically avoid making permanent modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits.

Wireless security strategies also enable push-button control of the system and general home automation.
