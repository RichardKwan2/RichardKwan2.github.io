<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment in this manner to make consumers stick with them longer, since switching monitoring companies implies numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't state which device was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>If there's one company challenging ADT's lawn indication monopoly, it's Xfinity Home Security The multi-platform company initially explored home security in 2011, and its signature red yard indication is nearly as ubiquitous as ADT's classic blue.
