However, an exception can be made for home security systems that include benefits like the ADT Mover's Savings Plan, which enable you to take your equipment to a new home. This also depends upon the provider, however you can anticipate signing an agreement with service providers who need expert installation of their systems. The average length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some agreements could cover as much as 60 months or 5 years.
