<h3>Outdoor Security Cameras in Lancaster MA</h3>

<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and again in client reviews, and it provides a crisp image as much as 32 feet.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and for that reason provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
