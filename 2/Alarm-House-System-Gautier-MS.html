<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need.

What good is a surveillance camera that only works ideally in ideal conditions like intense sunlight?
