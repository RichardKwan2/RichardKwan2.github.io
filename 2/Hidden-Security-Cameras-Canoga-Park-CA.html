<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment this way to make customers stay with them longer, because switching monitoring companies means hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
<p>One of the first choices that you'll require to make is if you need a wireless or wired security camera system, and the right answer likely depends upon where you mean to place the cameras and elements. If you have the luxury of having the ability to drill holes and run wires, you'll appreciate not needing to handle batteries, and might wish to look at a wired system. On the other hand, if running wires isn't practical, you'll delight in the adaptability that Wi-Fi and wireless cameras provide. All these factors to consider will impact what system you ultimately choose. For example, if you need to record high-definition surveillance video over long periods, bandwidth is a consideration.</p>

<p>In addition, surveillance cameras protect against residential or commercial property theft, and vandalism. If there are cameras filming you, it is very tough to get away with stealing something.
