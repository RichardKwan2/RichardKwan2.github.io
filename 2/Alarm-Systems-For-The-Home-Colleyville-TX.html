<p>The first wireless function to think about is the security system and its components, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring part was hard-wired back to a panel box. This suggested every door and window needed its own wire and course of holes through your house. Wireless systems use radio frequencies that are only effective as much as a particular radius. You will need a system that has a long reception variety and can handle a more substantial amount of information and signals if you have a big home. Keep in mind: A home bigger than 4,500 square feet is usually much better off using a wired system.</p>
