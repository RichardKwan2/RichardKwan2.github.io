<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with a tempting opportunity for criminal abuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-ranking police official in Washington, DC was captured utilizing police databases to gather details on patrons of a gay club. By searching for the license plate numbers of parking lot at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the automobiles' owners, he tried to blackmail clients who were wed. Imagine what somebody like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>The real factor cameras are typically released is to decrease much pettier criminal offenses. However it has actually not even been demonstrated that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been extensively deployed in public places, sociologists studying the problem have actually discovered that they have actually not lowered crime. "When the criminal offense and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the general downward pattern in offenses and crimes," criminologists discovered in one research study, "decreases were kept in mind in particular classifications but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had reduced criminal activity in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Office likewise found that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British federal government).</p>
