<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you require extra cables.

As soon as a zone has actually been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
