<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the entire community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you plan to keep and for how long you plan to keep recorded video footage. The video is going to eat up storage area quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage when you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>
