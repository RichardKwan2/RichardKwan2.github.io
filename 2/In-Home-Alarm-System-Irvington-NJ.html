<p>Security: There have been plenty of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, baby monitors, and other Wi-Fi gadgets to spy on people, so make sure to check what actions has each producer required to eliminate this issue. Try to find a camera that supports up-to-date wireless security procedures, such as WPA2, and make sure it secures web transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds. Never ever install a security camera (or a router or any other gadget on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>

<p>On the surface, these two camera classifications might appear similar, though if you had the ability to see within, the distinctions become unique and obvious. Commercial-grade cameras are designed and developed for high-performance applications where failure is not an option; consumer-grade cameras are not. Typically, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is a lot of offered light, and as soon as the lighting ends up being low or absent (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show. Commercial cameras exceed their cheaper cousins since they have bigger internal video sensors and higher-quality elements that can adjust and capture exceptional low light video.</p>

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later developed to resolve the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA essentially uncrackable.
