<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to aim to make a camera with the most difficult setup known to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi info.
