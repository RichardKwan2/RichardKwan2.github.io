The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying an opportunity for the malicious assaulter to tape-record these codes and utilize various breaking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can release a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based upon the "model" security essential recorded during the network recovery.</p>
