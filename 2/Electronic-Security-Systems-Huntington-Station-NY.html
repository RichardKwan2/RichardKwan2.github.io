For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make consumers stay with them longer, because switching monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for consumers.
