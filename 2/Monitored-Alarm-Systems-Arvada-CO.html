<p>SimpliSafe may be too minimal for you if you have a larger home or property you desire to keep an eye on. The only outdoor security camera that's presently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is fantastic for keeping an eye on visitors and bundle shipments, but it leaves other parts of your lawn susceptible. If you have a big lawn or outbuildings to safeguard, this system might not be the best fit. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not require a base station-- it links straight to any Wi-Fi network. But you can link the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is readily available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web internet browser. Aside from offering simple access to recordings, the app enables you to adjust sensitivity so that you're not getting informs every 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
