<h3>Good Home Security Systems in New Hampshire</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider area and therefore offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
