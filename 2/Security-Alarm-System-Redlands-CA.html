The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
