This appearance is identifiable to almost everyone and hence serves as a deterrent to undesirable people. The hope is bad guys and trespassers go elsewhere instead if security cameras are visible. That being said, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism due to the fact that of their obvious look. Furthermore, the shape of the camera is ideal for concentrating on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but needs several cameras if a user needs to see several set views.
