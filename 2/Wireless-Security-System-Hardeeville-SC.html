When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

<p>Unlike wired security systems that run through your phone lines and can need more extensive installation, wireless systems can be installed in a matter of minutes as a fast and pain-free  DIY project. Convenience is the major factor individuals switch to wireless," states Du, and it's tough to refute a 10-minute setup when the wired choice requires professional installation of wires below your house.
