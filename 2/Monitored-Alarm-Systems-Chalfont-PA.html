<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, fraud, and vandalism. Idea: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We should again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of eliminating expensive incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically turn off the heater. You can instantly make the smart lights turn on to frighten away possible burglars if the motion sensing units are activated.</p>

With conventional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transmitted in analog format for local seeing from one main monitoring area. But that does not indicate you can't use analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Utilizing IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to leverage your existing analog cameras while moving into the world of digital surveillance.</p>
