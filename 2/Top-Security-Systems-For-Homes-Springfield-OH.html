<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
