It is geared up with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensing unit, so whenever there's some motion found, it can send you a push notification in your phone so you can respond to it immediately. In addition, the motion sensing unit here is much more sophisticated than the ones provided by adobe Beginner Set. Because it is a PIR motion sensing unit, it only gets activated when it catches motion from something emitting infrared energy, i.e., individuals and animals.
