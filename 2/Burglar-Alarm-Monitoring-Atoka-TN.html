The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our screening, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.
