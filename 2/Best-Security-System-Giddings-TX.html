The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal construction.

Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
