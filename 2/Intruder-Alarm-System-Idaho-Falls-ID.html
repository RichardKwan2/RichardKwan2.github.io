<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
