When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system.
