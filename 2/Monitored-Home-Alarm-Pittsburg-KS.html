Never install a security camera (or a router or any other gadget on your home network) without altering its default user ID and password.</p>

<p>The majority of modern CCTV video surveillance systems incorporate DVRs (digital video recorders) which enable operators to enjoy a few of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs convert the analog footage to digital, which helps to extend storage capacity, makes it much easier to search archived footage, and also permits users to stream video over a network for remote watching from several areas. Often, the mere presence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated trespassers. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more identified burglars. They may also be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks if burglars can not see any security cameras.</p>
