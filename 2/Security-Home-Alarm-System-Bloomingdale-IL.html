Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they occur regularly enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working.

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
