<p>As explained by Cornish and Clarke (2003 ), CCTV is a kind of official surveillance," meaning that not just does CCTV have the capability to take the place of cops or security officers however CCTV can also boost officers' capabilities (Welsh and Farrington 2008). In addition to working as a deterrent, cameras can alert cops of criminal activities as they take place, which can enable officers to react rapidly and efficiently (La Vigne et al. 2011).

And since ADT provides same- and next-day installation, you can get that extra security in no time, which appears like good value.</p>
