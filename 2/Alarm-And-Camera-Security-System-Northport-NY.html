<p>Discover how to design, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and minimize crime. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was malfunctioning, and so we might revisit this review. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud. The large face of the camera provides you an impressive field of view, and the image you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll utilize to wait to the cloud.)
