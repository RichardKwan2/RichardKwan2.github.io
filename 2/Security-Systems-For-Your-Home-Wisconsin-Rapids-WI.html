Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night.
