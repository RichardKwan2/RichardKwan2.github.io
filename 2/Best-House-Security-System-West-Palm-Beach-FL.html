Considering that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when notifications are off).

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never ever matches the maker's stats considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for brief battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit limited to advise as a top pick.</p>
