It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send out voice cautions through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you focus on the action. Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost 6 months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its guarantee of approximately one year of battery life.
