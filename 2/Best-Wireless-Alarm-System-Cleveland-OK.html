It also includes two days of totally free cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can pack in clips of up to 3 minutes.

Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control panel and keypads, different sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.
