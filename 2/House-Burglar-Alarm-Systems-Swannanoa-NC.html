<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
