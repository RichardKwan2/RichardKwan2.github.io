It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>ADT, Frontpoint, and Vivint all sell pet-friendly motion detectors when it comes to indoor security equipment. Their detectors utilize infrared innovation, so its more difficult for a pet dog or cat to trip the sensing unit. Vivint's sensing units are immune to family pets weighing as much as 33 to 55 pounds.

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
