<p>Since it's more complicated than it ought to be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
