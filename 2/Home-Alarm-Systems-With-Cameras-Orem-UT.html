<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize too (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
