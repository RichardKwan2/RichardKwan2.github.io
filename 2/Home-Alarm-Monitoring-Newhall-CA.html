<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, scams, and theft. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again react to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it instantly shut off the heating systems.
