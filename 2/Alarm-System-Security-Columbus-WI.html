<p>Often a wired system can be puzzled with local alarms. Nevertheless, the 2 are drastically various.

It can be controlled from another location through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile device or through the control board (also known as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capability to couple with other wise devices and can not be controlled remotely. Likewise a local alarm will not call the authorities; it merely sets off an audible siren to notify people close by.</p>
