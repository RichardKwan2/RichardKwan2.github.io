Whether you own or rent, you desire the very best security camera system for keeping an eye on your home while you're gone. That used to require finalizing on with a professional-- and costly-- security service like ADT. However a boom in consumer-level smart-home tech is putting outdoor and indoor home surveillance into our own hands. At Valley Alarm, we do not sell equipment packages" that provide only the impression of security.

<p>Big national alarm companies such as ADT sometimes use exclusive communicators which will ONLY work with their main station.

<p>Another way to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through making use of a digital video recorder (DVR).
