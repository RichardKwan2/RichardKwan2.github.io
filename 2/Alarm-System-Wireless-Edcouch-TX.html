<p>This nifty smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During screening, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was spotted. We enjoy that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need numerous Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey.
