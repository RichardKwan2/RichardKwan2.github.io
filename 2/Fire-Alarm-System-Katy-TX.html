<h3>Home Camera System Katy TX 77449</h3>
<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with advanced wise home enthusiasts or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. However the Secure is pricey, additional sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise pricey if you do not commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>Ping Camera - This desktop camera is useful for home security and staying in touch with member of the family.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
