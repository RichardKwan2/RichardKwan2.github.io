<p>Prospective clients might find ADT's prices scheme to be disagreeable: it's tough to discover clear details on expenses on the company's site, and you won't have an idea of your security system's rate until a technician comes to your home and draws up a proposal.

Ring makes a variety of popular video doorbells, but the company faces bothersome personal privacy issues over its questionable data-sharing partnerships with cops organizations. And, according to reports, countless Ring clients recently had their account information exposed. We do not recommend any of the company's products at this point.</p>
