<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely love it. Terrific clearness. I wanted to establish seeing on my cell phone however had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would definitely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter informs, for instance. Nevertheless, those functions come at a relatively high cost: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for one month of video history.  For each extra camera, the membership is discounted to about half of the initial fee. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 monthly for individual detection with 1 month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those functions and bumps storage as much as 31 days.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
