In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, usually via 110VAC power.</p>
