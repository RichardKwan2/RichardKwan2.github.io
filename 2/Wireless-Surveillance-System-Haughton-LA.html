<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
