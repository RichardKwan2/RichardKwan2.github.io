<p>ADT licensed provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, but the brand name does not otherwise charge up front for a system it states is worth $1,300.

ADT uses an independent distributor model including third-party dealerships. The dealerships identify which equipment to utilize. Expenses for systems vary. Larger systems that use full-house protection with professional monitoring are the most expensive alternatives. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most cost effective option.</p>
<p>In regards to its function list, it's an outstanding package - there's a heat sensing unit in addition to a camera, which lowers the number of false positives you're going to get, plus two-way audio and night vision.

In truth, dissatisfied consumers typically have a problem getting through to skilled professionals when they have technical problems.</p>
