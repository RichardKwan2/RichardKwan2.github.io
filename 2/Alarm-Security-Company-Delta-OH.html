A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that can finding small distinctions in temperature level.

When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
