Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you plan to keep and how long you plan to keep documented video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly.
