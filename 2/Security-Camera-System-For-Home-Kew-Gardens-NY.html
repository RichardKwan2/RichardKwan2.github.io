<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest offender for brief battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capability is a bit limited to recommend as a top choice.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to use too (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a knowing curve.

If you don't currently have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to require to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can suggest there are range issues.</p>
