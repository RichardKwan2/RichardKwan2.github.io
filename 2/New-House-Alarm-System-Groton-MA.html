<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even trigger false alarms. False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the police if they happen often enough.

<h3>Security Cameras For Your Home in Groton MA</h3>

Now, most security systems include a multitude of components, such as a base station, security camera, motion, entry, and glass break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few components.

It is thought that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will minimize criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
