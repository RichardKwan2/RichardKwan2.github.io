<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
